The name _ZikiChombo_ comes from the swahili "Muziki Chombo"  Muziki means
music and chombo means machine or instrument or device.  It is probably
not the best translation of what is commonly considered a "musical instrument", 
but the idea here is that our tools _are_ the instrument or device.

ZikiChombo was created by Scott Cotton at IRI France, SAS as a result of
frustrations working with audio in Go.  IRI France, SAS is a french 1-person
LLC.  The company manages ZikiChombo in accordance with the goals and methods
presented here.

Go is a great language, and it is general purpose.  Some may conclude that
commercial grade audio applications are well within Go's reach, and from a
language perspective they are.  But from an ecosystem perspective, they are, at
least in general, definitely not.  ZikiChombo is here to fix that, providing
one niche ecosystem for developers working with Sound in Go, to be part of
providing the world's first solution achieving at once simple, reliable, and
efficient sound processing software tools.
