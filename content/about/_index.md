The name _ZikiChombo_ comes from the swahili "Muziki Chombo"  Muziki means
music and chombo means machine or instrument or device.

ZikiChombo was created by Scott Cotton at IRI France, SAS as a result of 
frustrations working with audio in Go.

Go is a great language, and it is general purpose.  Some may conclude that
commercial grade audio applications are well within Go's reach, and from
a language perspective they are.  But from an ecosystem perspective, they are,
at least in general, definitely not.  ZikiChombo provides one niche ecosystem
for developers working with Sound in Go, to be part of providing a one-stop
solution to a variety of needs in sound processing.
