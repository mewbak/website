We are open source for the quality of the software, 
not for offering charitable free labor to enterprises.
```

We need and ask for your support by any and all of the following.

# General Sponsorship

## Donate/Drop a dime
If you just like our project, then drop us a dime and we'll put it 
to use.

## Get your name on our site
We'll shout your name from the rooftops!

## Earmarks
You can earmark your sponsorship for specific goals and functionality
and be provided with or have published how the funds were spent.

# Sponsorship by developers
Developers provide support by engaging our project.

## Giving our libraries a shot.
Using and trying to use our libraries on a test run helps.  Even if you
don't end up doing much, it gives you the opportunity to give us feedback
and file issues.

## Filing issues
The filing of issues comprises major and irreplacable contributions.
It lets us track and resolve problems.

## Send us pull requests
You can send pull requests, and we can incorporate them after review.
Incorporation will only take place after licensing has been clearly
established for the ZikiChombo project.  Pull requests that pass review
but do not clearly establish licensing in a timely fashion will be dropped.

## Become an upstream supplier.
We vet upstream suppliers of functionality for release planning and
licensing.  But audio processing is full of too many challenges to 
achieve "no extenal dependencies" and broad functionality at once.
Got a codec you'd like us to use?  A driver?  We may well want it.
So drop us a line.

## Engaging in technical discussions.
Our issues contain technical discussions in which all opinions are 
appreciated.  Chime in and help drive the dialog to fruition.
