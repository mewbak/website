```
We are open source, by and for gophers, and for quality.
```

We divide contribution activity into 

1. [Developer Contributions](/contrib/dev/)
1. [Commercial and General Sponsorship](/contrib/sponsor/). 

If you are putting ZikiChombo code to commercial use, we kindly request that
you estimate a fair and reasonable value that it provides to your sales, and
figure out how to give back by examing the options here.  This will help
maintain our OSS quality standards and ultimately be to your benefit.
