## Commercial contributions and General Sponsorship

Below we outline some ideas for financial and general contributions.
In case it concerns you, please note the relationship between ZikiChombo and 
the parent company at the bottom of this page.

### Drop a dime
If you just like our project, then drop us a dime and we'll put it 
to use.

### Get your name on our site
We'll shout your name from the rooftops!

### Earmarks/Bounties
You can earmark your sponsorship for specific goals and functionality and be
provided with or have published via issue tracker tags how the funds were
spent.  However, our members reserve the right and have a duty to prioritize
their work based on community-wide demand.

### Paraphenalia
We are looking forward to seeing some rockin, drum thwacking, deep rhythm
dancin' and even Mozart-or-Yo-Yo-Ma-esque gophers. Designs welcome 
and we'd like to offer a prize to the winner.  If you donate and send us a mail
indicating you'd like to see your donation make some gophers rock we'll
task the money to this prize.

### Contact
Email is our most effective mechanism for establishing 1-1 contact.  We can 
exchange phone/video or in person after that as needed.

### Relationship to IRI France, SAS
When you give money for ZikiChombo, the money is directed to IRI France, SAS, a
French 1 person LLC dedicated to R&D.  IRI France, SAS, (hereafter refered to as IFS) in turn 
keeps track of these funds and documents their distribution to the ZikiChombo project
in accordance with the principles, goals, and methods put forth on this site.

Additionally, IFS itself sponsors ZikiChombo with time and money for
infrastructure.  To distinguish IFS's sponsorship from yours, IFS's
contributions to ZikiChombo are automatically split in half:  half of all
resources given to ZikiChombo are pure grants, and the other half are
no-interest loans which are to be paid back from ZikiChombo revenue when
available.  In this way, you can be assured that your donations, destined for
IFS are indeed supporting ZikiChombo and at the same time, IFS is indeed
sponsoring ZikiChombo and enforcing that your donation be used exclusively for
ZikiChombo.  If you consider yourself a significant donor, please feel free
to contact us with requests for documentation of how your funds are spent.

We hope to turn ZikiChombo into it's own legal entity, perhaps a non-profit
or french "Association".  This requires resources and growth and is currently
not logistically in scope.
