## Commercial contributions and General Sponsorship

If you are putting ZikiChombo code to commercial use, we kindly
request that you estimate a fair and reasonable value that it
provides, commenserate with your sales, and figure out how 
to give back by examing the options here.  This will help maintain 
our OSS quality standards and ultimately your benefit. 

When you give money for ZikiChombo, the money is directed to IRI France, SAS, a
French 1 person LLC dedicated to R&D.  IRI France, SAS, (hereafter refered to as IFS) in turn 
keeps track of these funds and documents their distribution to the ZikiChombo project
in accordance with the principles, goals, and methods put forth on this site.

Additionally, IFS itself sponsors ZikiChombo with time and money for
infrastructure.  To distinguish IFS's sponsorship from yours, IFS's
contributions to ZikiChombo are automatically split in half:  half of all
resources given to ZikiChombo are pure grants, and the other half are
no-interest loans which are to be paid back from ZikiChombo revenue when
available.  In this way, you can be assured that your donations, destined for
IFS are indeed supporting ZikiChombo and at the same time, IFS is indeed
sponsoring ZikiChombo and enforcing that your donation be used exclusively for
ZikiChombo.  If you consider yourself a significant donor, please feel free
to contact us with requests for documentation of how your funds are spent.

We are not so interested in dual licensing because we feel it tends to
make the software harder to build/install.  

That said, please consider the following:

### Drop a dime
If you just like our project, then drop us a dime and we'll put it

### Get your name on our site
We'll shout your name from the rooftops!

### Earmarks/Bounties
You can earmark your sponsorship for specific goals and functionality
and be provided with or have published how the funds were spent via
issue tracker tags.  However, our members reserve the right and have 
a duty to prioritize their work based on community-wide demand.

### Paraphenalia
We are looking forward to seeing some rockin, drum thwacking, deep rhythm
dancin' and even Mozart-or-Yo-Yo-Ma-esque gophers. Designs welcome 
and we'd like to offer a prize to the winner.  If you donate and send us a mail
indicating you'd like to see your dontation make some gophers rock we'll
task the money to this prize.
